This is a preliminary version of code of NU-NeRF. This code only serves as a preview for the shepards and reviewers, all the personal identitity information has been cleaned.
The code is not intended to run, with a lot of modules not sufficiently tested, and some dirty workaround preserved. 
The later published version will solve these problems.
