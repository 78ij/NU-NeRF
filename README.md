This is a preliminary version of code of NU-NeRF. This code only serves as a preview for the shepards and reviewers, all the personal identitity information has been cleaned.
This codebase is built upon the published code of NeRO. Currently, the code is not intended to run, with a lot of modules not sufficiently tested, and some dirty workaround preserved. 
The later published version will solve these problems.
